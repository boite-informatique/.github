## Hello There 👋

We are **PingWin**, an IT service provider founded by a group of motivated computer science 💻 students from Algeria. We are passionate about technology and love exploring new ways to leverage it for the benefit of our clients. In the past, we have developed "ESI HUB", a social network for the community of ESI SBA, a leading college in Algeria. Our team is currently working on an IT solution to facilitate the process of turning students’ projects into Diploma-Startup Diploma-Patent.
